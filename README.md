Hi everyone!! ðŸ™‹ðŸ™‹

My name is Marvellous Uyom and I am interested in frontend development.
I am a self taught developer. I started learning HTML last year November, 2021.
Using Sololearn app, I completed HTML course early 2022 and then I moved on to CSS.
So far, I have gotten two certificates on html and css.

Now, I am interested in learning JavaScript.
